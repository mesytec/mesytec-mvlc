# Changelog

## v0.2

### USB / FTDI D3XX
- New structure for the FTDI D3XX drivers. Merged the x64 and aarch64 USB implementations.
- Linux: support ftdi-d3xx 1.1.8.
- Linux: improved command pipe timeouts and performance.
- Linux: fix stale replies after a USB reset and recover locked up MVLCs.
- Windows: load ftd3xx 1.3 (FTDIBUS3) and 1.4 (WinUSB) at runtime.
- Windows: read the command pipe one max packet at a time, 100 ms command pipe read timeout,
  no abort on command read timeouts.
- cmd_pipe_reader: removed an infinite loop, count orphaned continuations, resync on bad
  continuation headers instead of stalling.

### ETH
- Fix the outgoing max packet size check, report
  `MVLCErrorCode::UdpMaxOutgoingPacketSizeExceeded`.

- No missing command warning on `--version` and `--help`.

### Logging
- spdlog logs to stderr by default.

### Build / Tests / Tools

- Added two USB dev/test tools.
